    <p>Currently events such as weddings, parties are organized by organizers with their limited known contacts of service providers (Services like Catering, DJ, Lighting, Saloons etc...)
    Therefore the customers and organizers are having hard time coordinating all necessary services for an event. At the same time service providers doesn't have a proper platform to advertise their services and the available time (According to their schedule).
    1) Make finding required service easier (According to the requirements such as venue, pricing, time)
    2)To make service providers to advertise their services and availability.
    3) To view particular service provider's previous feedbacks and rating.</p>
