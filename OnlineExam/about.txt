Hi guys,I am mugunthan from association of SO CALLED ENGINEERS..

I will be focused, curious, polite, self-aware. Add a dash of confidence and the gift of being articulate.

Good is different for everybody, and you should determine what good is to you and develop a personal
that reflects that. 

These adjectives define what a good student is to me:

1.Goal-Orientation

2.Ambitious
