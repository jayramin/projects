        <h2>Marketing in New Zealand</h2>
       
        <p>Marketing in New Zealand aims at giving the students a sound understanding of the principles and practices of business in real-world settings. The main goal of marketing courses is to develop their capabilities and skills that future employers need in their workforce. Students are provided with opportunities to apply their learning to real projects, where they can formulate effective solutions that address real business issues. Whatever industry someone chooses, it almost always requires a marketing department; such is the requirement of marketing professionals.</p>
        
        <h3>Why choose New Zealand</h3>
        <p>New Zealand offers students the best of both worlds -the sophistication and modernity of a cosmopolitan country mixed with an easygoing lifestyle. From rolling green hills to golden sand beaches and lush rainforests, the New Zealand countryside provides a unique and spectacular experience. With an international reputation as a provider of quality education, the country offers the best study opportunities and support services for international students, as well as a safe learning experience. With a number of state-of-the-art facilities, New Zealand universities for marketing are governed by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority which ensures that international standards for the courses are maintained.</p>          
        
        
        <h3>Choosing the right university</h3>
        <p>From eight public universities (5 of which have been listed in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings), international students can have their pick for a marketing university. Though there is an abundance of choice, choosing the right college for studying marketing in New Zealand is a decision that can shape one's future career. The crux of the matter is that everyone has varying requirements of what they need from the chosen university. Some pay more heed to the academic standing of the university, while some require the establishment to have a great placement track record. The trick is to clear out what one requires in an educational establishment and then decide which university will suit their purposes the best.</p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>Like any course, marketing too has various kinds of degrees varying from undergraduate to diploma courses. Each course in each university has its own set of requirements which need to be fulfilled by a student. The basic requirements of course are academic certifications and English language proficiency. For international students, the requirements for academic qualifications are proof of certification in the relevant previous courses, with scores that comply with New Zealand's marking system. Also required are applicable scores from a recognized English Language proficiency test like IELTS.</p>
