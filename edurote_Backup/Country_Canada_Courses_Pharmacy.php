        <h2>Pharmacy Courses in Canada</h2>
       
        <p>Choosing to study Pharmacy courses in Canada provides students with in depth knowledge about medicinal substances and their application for therapeutic uses. An education in pharmacy is a stream of study based on how drug molecules are formulated into medicine. Students are free to use this knowledge to develop new ways of delivering drugs safely and effectively. A Pharmacy course typically focuses on physics, biology, anatomy, physiology, and chemistry. An integral part of the healthcare industry, trained Pharmacists can be involved in any and all aspects of drug and medicine use, whether the first discovery, the drug’s development, or its supply to patients.</p>
