        <h1>University / College Scholarship & Grants can be broadly divided under two heads:</h1>
        <h3>Admission Based</h3>
        <p>You will be eligible for Scholarship simply after successfully getting admission into particular institute. There is no separate condition to satisfy for such scholarship.</p>
        
        <h3>Condition Based</h3>
        <p>After or before getting admission you will have to satisfy a particular condition or set of conditions laid down by institute to be eligible for scholarship.</p>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <p>Fixed amount of Scholarship, % of Discount on full fee payment, Free Accommodation etc. The scholarship amount may vary from Rs.35000/- to Rs. 200000/- approximately or more.</p>
        
        <h3>External Scholarships</h3>

        <h3>Scholarship through Term / Study Exemption</h3>
        <p>Term or Study exemptions are granted to those students who have completed part of their studies in India and aspiring to continue their further studies in abroad. Hence, it enables you to get direct admission into higher studies without having completing the entire course and save your money & valuable years.</p>
        <h4>For Example</h4>
        <p>If you are a Diploma holder in Aeronautical Engineering and want to study Bachelor degree course, we will assist you in getting direct admission into 2nd year of degree course. Hence, instead of 3 or 4 years you may complete B.E. (Hons) degree in 2 years.</p>
        <h4>Please Note</h4>
        <p>The final decision on study exemption will be taken by the respective institute based on your past academic result, subjects completed etc.</p>
