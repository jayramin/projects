        <p>Admission has been secured and visa granted. The process doesn't just end there. In all the excitement, one tends to forget other necessary details required to study abroad. We take care of planning out those important things like travel and health insurance, accommodation and all the other steps to ensure that the student settles in the new country without any difficulties.</p>
        <p>The institutes represented by us follow strict guidelines to take care of students who have come overseas and deal with any problem they might be facing in a prompt manner. They also implement Pastoral Care Programmers which ensure a nurturing environment for students.</p>
        <p>More importantly, we brief students on a number of issues such as the culture and customs followed in the new country. The cultural differences might create friction with the locals; hence they are informed regarding the appropriate behavior and decorum to be maintained there. We advise them in protocols to be followed in case of medical or other emergencies. They are also briefed on location of basic utilities, book stores and safe entertainment avenues around the campus.</p>
        <p>In summation, the pre-departure briefing is a complete informational package that will make less travelled young students self-sufficient in the new part of the world.</p>
