        <h2>Biotechnology in Canada</h2>
       
        <p>Through courses in biotechnology in Canada, students examine the genetic makeup of organisms found on Earth. This includes plants, animals and people, along with the genetic diseases that affect them and the possible solutions for those diseases. This course usually incorporates a mix of lecture-based courses and lab work in biology, chemistry, biochemistry as well as biotechnology. Sometimes, courses on biotechnology in Canada include an internship as well. Master's-level students may go in depth in topics like biotechnology applications and research design, with programs culminating in a thesis.</p>
