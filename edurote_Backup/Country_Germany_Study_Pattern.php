        <h2>Education System in Germany</h2>
        <p>The great majority of German universities have traditionally been maintained by the state - that is to say, by the federal state in which the educational institute is located - and this continues to be the case today, hence there are no or very low fees. Germany is arguably the only country in the World where completion of study programs in Universities is smoothly followed by paid internship in top MNCs that eventually may lead to full-time placement. </p>     
<p>Nowadays, most of the Universities offer courses that are taught in English. Degrees in Germany are offered in the two-tier international system of bachelor's and master's degrees, with credits for attendance and examination passes that can be accumulated and transferred. There are only two types of Universities in Germany - Technical Universities (TU) & Universities of Applied Sciences (FH).

        <p>Each University in Germany is autonomous and has its own teaching methods and course structures. University teacher usually speaks on specific topic & student can follow up in the textbook material. Students earn credits to attend such lectures. In some cases examination is conducted at the end of semester to help demonstrate the knowledge gained from the taught subject. </p>
        
        <p><b>Seminars & Assignments</b></p>
        <p>Usually seminars & assignments are extension to lecture which requires student to do presentation, group play, group discussion etc. Seminars & assignments are usually held in small groups & every student plays an active role.

        <p><b>Tutorials</b></p>
        <p>Tutorials are usually to deepen the learning after lectures & seminars and are usually headed by advanced / seniors students.

        <p><b>Exercise / Revision</b></p>

        <p><b>Internships / Practical Training</b></p>
        <p>Some subjects also include internship to be undertaken by student as a part of the study & are usually supervised by the university.

        <p><b>Plagiarism</b></p>
        <p>Plagiarism means presenting/copying someone else's work as your own.
