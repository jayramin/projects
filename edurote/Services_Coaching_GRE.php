        <h1>GRE Format</h1>
        <p>The GRE is a multiple-choice multi-stage test that measures verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, critical thinking and analytical writing skills. It has been designed in a way so as to calculate the student's intellectual and logical abilities, adapting to performance by selecting questions based on previous answers. The test allows its takers to skip questions within a section, go back and change answers and have the flexibility to choose which questions within a section they want to answer first.</p>
        <p>The GRE question types are designed to closely reflect the kind of thinking that students will be expected to do in graduate or business school and are based upon the following skills:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Verbal Reasoning -</b> This section measures a student's ability to analyze and evaluate written material and to synthesize information obtained from it. It measures the ability to analyze relationships among component parts of sentences and recognize relationships among concepts and words.</li>
            <li><b>Quantitative Reasoning - </b>This section measures a student's problem-solving ability and focusses on basic concepts of algebra, arithmetic, data analysis and geometry.</li>
            <li><b>Analytical Writing -</b> This section measures analytical writing skills and critical thinking. It specifically measure's a student's ability to articulate and support ideas that are complex in nature both clearly and effectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Eduroute Private Limited 10 key insights into the GRE:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The GRE selects questions in groups, or stages meaning that it is critical to perform well section by section rather than question by question.</li>
            <li>The difficulty of questions is governed by performance in the preceding ones. Difficulty levels therefore alter in accordance with the student's answers as they progress through the test.</li>
            <li>The first section is reflective of an 'average' difficulty level.</li>
            <li>The student has the provision to skip, navigate and return, and change their responses within a section. However, once they finish with a section, they cannot return to it.</li>
            <li>There is a 'mark and review' feature to mark questions the student may want to review later.</li>
            <li>The student will be scored on the basis of the number of questions answered, the number of correct answers and the difficulty level of the sections.</li>
            <li>The GRE can be taken once every 21 days, up to five times within any continuous 12-month period (365 days)</li>
            <li>Scores are valid for five years after the testing year in which a student was tested.</li>
            <li>There is an on-screen calculator for use in the Quantitative Reasoning section to reduce the emphasis on computation and to ensure that the student focuses more attention on reasoning skills.</li>
            <li>There is emphasis within the test on the student's knowledge of vocabulary through reading.</li>

        <h2>GRE FAQs</h2>
        <h4>Q.Does the GRE General Test measure knowledge in any specific disciplines?</h4>
        <p>The GRE Practice Test measures a student's verbal and quantitative reasoning, critical thinking and analytical writing skills – disciplines that are relevant to every field of study and important in graduate or business schools.</p>
        
        <h4>Q.How is the GRE scored?</h4>
        <p>The first sections of the Verbal and Quantitative Reasoning parts range from the levels of 'Easy' to 'Difficult'. Each subsequent section is administered based on the student's overall performance in the preceding section. A score of 130 - 170 per section is generated for the Verbal and Quantitative sections. Both scores are then added to give a total score of 260 - 340.    </p>
        
        <h4>Q.What kind of writing software does the AWA section employ?</h4>
        <p>Students will use a basic word processor developed by ETS. The basic word processor contains a number of functionalities: insert text, delete text, cut-and-paste and undo the previous action. Other tools such as a grammar checker or a spell checker and are not available in the ETS software. This makes essay writing fair in relation to handwritten essays of the students in the paper-based tests.</p>
        
        <h4>Q.Is it advisable to re-take the GRE if the score received in the first attempt is low?</h4>
        <p>Students must make a concerted effort to prepare for the GRE the second time and retake the exam, if they feel that their GRE test scores do not reflect their actual capabilities.</p>
        
        <h4>Q.For what duration is a GRE score valid?</h4>
        <p>A GRE score is valid for five years. While a student can retake the exam to improve upon scores, Institutions will have access to all your scores registered in the last five years. Hence, candidates are advised to prepare thoroughly before appearing for the exam.</p>
        
         <h4>Q.When do I consider myself ready to take the GRE?</h4>
        <p>Our 48-hour module is specifically customised and designed to make a candidate 'exam ready'. However if a student is deemed to be under prepared, we offer a combination of extra tutoring, further mock tests and result-oriented strategic sessions to prepare the student to take the GRE.</p>
